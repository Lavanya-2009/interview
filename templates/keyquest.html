Understanding these fundamentals is key to writing C programs.",
                    "Control Flow": "C provides powerful control structures such as if-else, loops (for, while, do-while), and switch-case. These control structures allow the programmer to make decisions and repeat actions, which are fundamental to program logic.",

                    "Pointers & Memory Management": "Pointers are variables that store the memory address of other variables. This concept is important for managing memory in programs. Functions like malloc() and free() are used for dynamic memory allocation.",
                    "Structures & Unions": "Structures are used to group variables of different data types under one name. Unions, on the other hand, allow different variables to share the same memory location.",
                    "File Handling": "C provides functions like fopen(), fclose(), fread(), and fwrite() for managing file input and output. Understanding file handling is essential for interacting with external data in your programs.",
